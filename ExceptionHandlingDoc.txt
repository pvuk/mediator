1. Response Statuses for Errors
Use appropriate status code based on the error.

404 - RESOURCE NOT FOUND
400 - BAD REQUEST
401 - UNAUTHORIZED
415 - UNSUPPORTED TYPE - Representation not supported for the resource
500 - SERVER ERROR
Letâ€™s consider a few HTTP Methods:

GET : Should not update anything. Should be idempotent (same result in multiple calls). Possible Return Codes 200 (OK) + 404 (NOT FOUND) +400 (BAD REQUEST)
POST : Should create new resource. Ideally return JSON with link to newly created resource. Same return codes as get possible. In addition - Return code 201 (CREATED) can be used.
PUT : Update a known resource. ex: update client details. Possible Return Codes : 200(OK) + 404 (NOT FOUND) +400 (BAD REQUEST)
DELETE : Used to delete a resource. Possible Return Codes : 200(OK).
500 - SERVER ERROR is possible with all the above HTTP methods. In the case of a 500, include the contact details of the help desk in the response.
