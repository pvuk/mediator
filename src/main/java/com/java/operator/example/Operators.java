 * Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators</a>
 * <p>
 * Java provides 4 bitwise and 3 bit shift operators to perform bit operations.
 * You will learn about them in detail in this article.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Bitwise and bit shift operators are used on integral types
 * (<code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code> and
 * <code>long</code>) to perform bit-level operations.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * These operators are not commonly used. You will learn about a few use cases
 * of bitwise operators in <i>Java enum type</i> chapter. This article will only
 * focus on how these operators work.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are 7 operators to perform bit-level operations in Java ( 4 bitwise and
 * 3 bit shift).

 * <h1>Bitwise operators in Java</h1>
 * <p>
 * Bitwise operators are used to perform manipulation of individual bits of a
 * number. They can be used with any of the integral types (char, short, int,
 * etc). They are used when performing update and query operations of Binary
 * indexed tree.

         * Bitwise AND
			Bitwise AND is a binary operator (operates on two operands). It's denoted by &.
			
			The & operator compares corresponding bits of two operands. If both bits are 1, it gives 1. If either of the bits is not 1, it gives 0. For example,
			
			12 = 00001100 (In Binary)
			25 = 00011001 (In Binary)
			
			Bit Operation of 12 and 25
			  00001100

			This operator is binary operator, denoted by ‘|’. It returns bit by bit OR of input values, i.e, if either of the bits is 1, it gives 1, else it gives 0.
			For example,
			a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
			b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)
			
			Bitwise OR Operation of 5 and 7
			  0101

         * Bitwise XOR is a binary operator (operates on two operands). It's denoted by ^.

			The ^ operator compares corresponding bits of two operands. If corresponding bits are different, it gives 1. If corresponding bits are same, it gives 0. For example,
			
			12 = 00001100 (In Binary)
			25 = 00011001 (In Binary)
			
			Bitwise XOR Operation of 12 and 25

         * Bitwise Complement
			Bitwise complement is an unary operator (works on only one operand). It is denoted by ~.
			
			The ~ operator inverts the bit pattern. It makes every 0 to 1, and every 1 to 0.
			
			35 = 00100011 (In Binary)
			
			Bitwise complement Operation of 35
