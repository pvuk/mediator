/**
 * <p>
 * 	The @Target annotation tells us where our annotation will be applicable. Here we are using ElementType.Method, which means it will only work on methods. If we tried to use the annotation anywhere else, then our code would fail to compile. This behavior makes sense, as our annotation will be used for logging method execution time.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	And @Retention just states whether the annotation will be available to the JVM at runtime or not. By default it is not, so Spring AOP would not be able to see the annotation. This is why itâ€™s been reconfigured.
